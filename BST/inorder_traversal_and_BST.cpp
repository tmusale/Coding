/*
Inorder Traversal and BST
Given an array, write a program that prints 1 if array represents Inorder traversal of a BST, else prints 0. 
Note that all keys in BST must be unique.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is N, 
N is the size of array. The second line of each test case contains N input C[i].

Output:
Print 1 array represents BST, else 0.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 500
1 ≤ Keys in BST ≤ 1200

Example:
Input
3
5
10 20 30 40 50
6
90 80 100 70 40 30
3
1 1 2

Output
1
0
